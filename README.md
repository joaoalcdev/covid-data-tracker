## 🔨 Architecture and Infrastructure for the Project

- Architecture:
  I would choose serverless as a viable option for this job. I would use a 'Function as a Service' (FaaS) like AWS Lambda. Serverless is a software and application design approach that allows developers to create and run services without having to manage and "configure" the work environment, as serverless as a cloud provider can predict and configure servers for future execution of their applications. , database and cloud storage systems as a function of scale.

- Infrastructure:
